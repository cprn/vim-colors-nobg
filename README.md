# vim-colors-nobg
A color scheme for Vim run in a terminal (meant to be used with a console - no
gui support). Works best with a semi-transparent dark background and your
terminal color palette. Feel free to use it however you may.

# Moved
Project moved to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cprn/vim-colors-nobg). If it's unavailable it's due to solving some quirks and will be accessible again soon.
